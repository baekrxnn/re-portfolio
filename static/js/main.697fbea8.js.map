Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n\t *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n\t *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n\t * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n\t *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n\t *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n\t *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n\t * - By default, the list looks for a `key` or `id` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n\t *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n\t *\n\t */\n\tvar VirtualizedList =\n\t/*#__PURE__*/\n\tfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n\t  _inheritsLoose(VirtualizedList, _React$PureComponent);\n\t\n\t  var _proto = VirtualizedList.prototype;\n\t\n\t  // scrollToEnd may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n\t  _proto.scrollToEnd = function scrollToEnd(params) {\n\t    var animated = params ? params.animated : true;\n\t    var veryLast = this.props.getItemCount(this.props.data) - 1;\n\t\n\t    var frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(veryLast);\n\t\n\t    var offset = Math.max(0, frame.offset + frame.length + this._footerLength - this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength);\n\t    /* $FlowFixMe(>=0.53.0 site=react_native_fb,react_native_oss) This comment\n\t     * suppresses an error when upgrading Flow's support for React.

It analyzes\n\t * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n\t * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n\t * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n\t *\n\t * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n\t * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n\t * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n\t *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n\t *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n\t *\n\t * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n\t * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n\t * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n\t * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n\t * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n\t * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n\t * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n\t * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n\t *\n\t * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n\t * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n\t *\n\t * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n\t *\n\t *   getInitialState: function() {\n\t *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n\t *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n\t *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n\t *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   // In render function:\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <View\n\t *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n\t *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n\t *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n\t *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n\t *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n\t *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n\t *       <View>\n\t *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n\t *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n\t *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n\t *       </View>\n\t *     </View>\n\t *   );\n\t *\n\t * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n\t *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n\t *\n\t * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n\t *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n\t *   that you should implement.\n\t *\n\t *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n\t *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n\t *   },\n\t *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n\t *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n\t *   },\n\t *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n\t *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n\t *   },\n\t *\n\t * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n\t *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n\t *     return 20;\n\t *   }\n\t *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n\t *   touchableGetPressRectOffset:

Integrate with your platform specific scroll\n\t * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\n\t * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n\t *\n\t * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n\t * ===============================\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n\t * -------------------------------\n\t *\n\t * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n\t *    ... physical touch starts ...\n\t * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n\t * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n\t * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n\t * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n\t * -------------------------------\n\t *\n\t * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n\t *    ... bounce begins ...\n\t *    ... some time elapses ...\n\t *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n\t * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n\t * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n\t * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n\t * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n\t * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n\t *\n\t * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n\t * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n\t * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n\t * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n\t *\n\t * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n\t * necessary\n\t *\n\t * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n\t * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n\t * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n\t * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n\t *\n\t * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n\t * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n\t * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n\t * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n\t * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n\t * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n\t * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n\t * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n\t * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n\t * events.\n\t *\n\t * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n\t *\n\t * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n\t *\n\t * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n\t * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n\t * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

It offers hooks for your component to provide\n\t * interaction feedback to the user:\n\t *\n\t * - When a press has activated (e.g. highlight an element)\n\t * - When a press has deactivated (e.g. un-highlight an element)\n\t * - When a press sould trigger an action, meaning it activated and deactivated\n\t *   while within the geometry of the element without the lock being stolen.\n\t *\n\t * A high quality interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should\n\t * be a slight delay before activation. Moving your finger beyond an element's\n\t * bounds should trigger deactivation, but moving the same finger back within an\n\t * element's bounds should trigger reactivation.\n\t *\n\t * In order to use `PressResponder`, do the following:\n\t *\n\t *     const pressResponder = new PressResponder(config);\n\t *\n\t * 2. Choose the rendered component who should collect the press events. On that\n\t *    element, spread `pressability.getEventHandlers()` into its props.\n\t *\n\t *    return (\n\t *      <View {...this.state.pressResponder.getEventHandlers()} />\n\t *    );\n\t *\n\t * 3. Reset `PressResponder` when your component unmounts.\n\t *\n\t *    componentWillUnmount() {\n\t *      this.state.pressResponder.reset();\n\t *    }\n\t *\n\t * ==================== Implementation Details ====================\n\t *\n\t * `PressResponder` only assumes that there exists a `HitRect` node.

Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n\t *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n\t *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n\t * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n\t *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n\t *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n\t *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n\t * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n\t *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n\t *\n\t * Also inherits [ScrollView Props](docs/scrollview.html#props), unless it is nested in another FlatList of same orientation.\n\t */\n\tvar FlatList =\n\t/*#__PURE__*/\n\tfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n\t  _inheritsLoose(FlatList, _React$PureComponent);\n\t\n\t  var _proto = FlatList.prototype;\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * Scrolls to the end of the content.

This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n\t * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n\t *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see\n\t *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n\t *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n\t * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n\t *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n\t *\n\t */\n\tvar SectionList =\n\t/*#__PURE__*/\n\tfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n\t  _inheritsLoose(SectionList, _React$PureComponent);\n\t\n\t  function SectionList() {\n\t    var _this;\n\t\n\t    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n\t      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    _this = _React$PureComponent.call.apply(_React$PureComponent, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n\t\n\t    _this._captureRef = function (ref) {\n\t      // $FlowFixMe\n\t      _this._wrapperListRef = ref;\n\t    };\n\t\n\t    return _this;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var _proto = SectionList.prototype;\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * Scrolls to the item at the specified `sectionIndex` and `itemIndex` (within the section)\n\t   * positioned in the viewable area such that `viewPosition` 0 places it at the top (and may be\n\t   * covered by a sticky header), 1 at the bottom, and 0.5 centered in the middle. `viewOffset` is a\n\t   * fixed number of pixels to offset the final target position, e.g. to compensate for sticky\n\t   * headers.\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: cannot scroll to locations outside the render window without specifying the\n\t   * `getItemLayout` prop.\n\t   */\n\t  _proto.scrollToLocation = function scrollToLocation(params) {\n\t    if (this._wrapperListRef != null) {\n\t      this._wrapperListRef.scrollToLocation(params);\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t  /**\n\t   * Tells the list an interaction has occurred, which should trigger viewability calculations, e.g.\n\t   * if `waitForInteractions` is true and the user has not scrolled.

The window adapts to scrolling behavior, and items\n * are rendered incrementally with low-pri (after any running interactions) if they are far from the\n * visible area, or with hi-pri otherwise to minimize the potential of seeing blank space.\n *\n * Some caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` or `id` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nvar VirtualizedList =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n  _inheritsLoose(VirtualizedList, _React$PureComponent);\n\n  var _proto = VirtualizedList.prototype;\n\n  // scrollToEnd may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n  _proto.scrollToEnd = function scrollToEnd(params) {\n    var animated = params ? params.animated : true;\n    var veryLast = this.props.getItemCount(this.props.data) - 1;\n\n    var frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(veryLast);\n\n    var offset = Math.max(0, frame.offset + frame.length + this._footerLength - this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength);\n    /* $FlowFixMe(>=0.53.0 site=react_native_fb,react_native_oss) This comment\n     * suppresses an error when upgrading Flow's support for React.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *

`ResponderEventPlugin`. Integrate with your platform specific scroll\n * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\n * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n * ===============================\n *\n *\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\nvar emptyObject = {};\nvar IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\nvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  // mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState() {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

It offers hooks for your component to provide\n * interaction feedback to the user:\n *\n * - When a press has activated (e.g. highlight an element)\n * - When a press has deactivated (e.g. un-highlight an element)\n * - When a press sould trigger an action, meaning it activated and deactivated\n *   while within the geometry of the element without the lock being stolen.\n *\n * A high quality interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should\n * be a slight delay before activation. Moving your finger beyond an element's\n * bounds should trigger deactivation, but moving the same finger back within an\n * element's bounds should trigger reactivation.\n *\n * In order to use `PressResponder`, do the following:\n *\n *     const pressResponder = new PressResponder(config);\n *\n * 2. Choose the rendered component who should collect the press events. On that\n *    element, spread `pressability.getEventHandlers()` into its props.\n *\n *    return (\n *      <View {...this.state.pressResponder.getEventHandlers()} />\n *    );\n *\n * 3. Reset `PressResponder` when your component unmounts.\n *\n *    componentWillUnmount() {\n *      this.state.pressResponder.reset();\n *    }\n *\n * ==================== Implementation Details ====================\n *\n * `PressResponder` only assumes that there exists a `HitRect` node.

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n * Also inherits [ScrollView Props](docs/scrollview.html#props), unless it is nested in another FlatList of same orientation.\n */\nvar FlatList =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n  _inheritsLoose(FlatList, _React$PureComponent);\n\n  var _proto = FlatList.prototype;\n\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the end of the content.

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nvar SectionList =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n  _inheritsLoose(SectionList, _React$PureComponent);\n\n  function SectionList() {\n    var _this;\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    _this = _React$PureComponent.call.apply(_React$PureComponent, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n\n    _this._captureRef = function (ref) {\n      // $FlowFixMe\n      _this._wrapperListRef = ref;\n    };\n\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  var _proto = SectionList.prototype;\n\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the item at the specified `sectionIndex` and `itemIndex` (within the section)\n   * positioned in the viewable area such that `viewPosition` 0 places it at the top (and may be\n   * covered by a sticky header), 1 at the bottom, and 0.5 centered in the middle. `viewOffset` is a\n   * fixed number of pixels to offset the final target position, e.g. to compensate for sticky\n   * headers.\n   *\n   * Note: cannot scroll to locations outside the render window without specifying the\n   * `getItemLayout` prop.\n   */\n  _proto.scrollToLocation = function scrollToLocation(params) {\n    if (this._wrapperListRef != null) {\n      this._wrapperListRef.scrollToLocation(params);\n    }\n  }\n  /**\n   * Tells the list an interaction has occurred, which should trigger viewability calculations, e.g.\n   * if `waitForInteractions` is true and the user has not scrolled.
